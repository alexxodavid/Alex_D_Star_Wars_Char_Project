# Alex_D_Star_Wars_Char_Project
This project helps me establish a connection with an API, provide a way to view groups or see each piece of data, search for something, and how to use JavaScript to render elements on to the DOM.
Used AI to help me get my project into a finished version from vite to being inside a dist/ folder. Wanted it to be more GitHub friendly.
